# ImagetoASCII

This is a simple program which will prompt the user to choose an image file to from their file explorer. It will then take the image and convert it to a copy of the image in black and white made out of ASCII characters. The approach I use converts the image to grayscale then uses the light intensity of a pixel to decide on an output ASCII character to paste into that location.

Run this program with: python imagetoascii.py
